# Some ideas to improve modelling

- Due to the large difference in image size, rescaling may not be the best preprocessing.
  It might be useful to use black or white as padding (and teaching the NN to ignore it)
  Rescaling might produce artifacts, reduce a characteristic
  or distract the NN by enlarging something irrelevant like water.
